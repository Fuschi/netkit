\title{Compute Graph Layout Using Only Positive Edges}
\usage{
layout_signed(graph, layout = igraph::with_fr())
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} object representing a graph (weighted or unweighted).}

\item{layout}{A layout specification (default: \code{with_fr()}). Any layout function from \code{igraph}
that can be passed to \code{layout_()} is accepted.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of layout coordinates (2 columns for 2D layouts; 3 columns for 3D).
}
\description{
Generates a graph layout by considering only the positively weighted edges of an input graph.
This is useful when visualizing signed graphs where positive interactions (e.g., cooperation, similarity)
are of primary interest. The default layout algorithm is Fruchterman-Reingold, but any \code{igraph} layout
function can be passed.
}
\details{
If the graph is weighted, the function retains only edges with strictly positive weights.
Edges with zero or negative weights are ignored when computing the layout. The returned layout
matrix can be used in standard igraph plotting functions.
}
\examples{
library(igraph)
g <- make_ring(10)
E(g)$weight <- c(1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1)

coords <- layout_signed(g)
plot(g, layout = coords)
