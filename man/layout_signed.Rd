\title{Compute a Graph Layout Using Only Positive Edges}
\usage{
layout_signed(graph, algorithm = igraph::with_fr(), circular = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} or \code{tbl_graph} object.}

\item{algorithm}{A layout specification passed to \code{igraph::layout_()},
such as \code{igraph::with_fr()} or \code{igraph::with_kk()}.}

\item{circular}{A logical value required for compatibility with \code{ggraph()}.
It is ignored by this function.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed by \code{ggraph()}; ignored.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns \code{x} and \code{y} (and possibly others),
suitable for use as a layout object in \code{ggraph()}.
}
\description{
Computes a graph layout by considering only the positively weighted edges
of the input graph. This is useful when visualizing signed networks in which
positive interactions (e.g., cooperation or similarity) are the primary
structure of interest. The default layout algorithm is Fruchterman–Reingold,
but any \code{igraph} layout specification can be used.
